    <p>
      Founded by American singer <strong>Brent Faiyaz</strong> and his manager
      <strong>Ty Baisden</strong>, Lost Kids is far more than just a music
      label. It’s a true artistic and entrepreneurial collective. The name comes
      from a group of Brent’s high school friends: “we were just lost kids.”
      This phrase perfectly captures the mindset behind the project, young
      people living outside the norms, finding their path through the streets,
      fashion, and creativity. <strong> Always “fly,” always different.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Musically, Lost Kids is a unique blend of alternative
      <strong>R&B</strong>, <strong>soul</strong>, <strong>rap/trap</strong>,
      and minimalist, atmospheric production, often inspired by the sounds of
      the 1990s and early 2000s. The label stands out for its rejection of
      conventions and its sincere approach: for Brent, more than the kicks or
      snares, what truly matters is the feeling and the message. This philosophy
      runs through every project, where music becomes a form of raw,
      <strong>emotional expression.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lost Kids goes far beyond music. The label also extends into
      <strong>fashion</strong>, <strong>start-ups</strong>,
      <strong>film</strong>, <strong></strong>start-ups</strong>, <strong>real estate investments</strong>, and
      <strong>philanthropic initiatives</strong>, reflecting a broad vision of creativity and
      independence. Brent and Ty have always stated that their goal was to keep
      full control over their art and their ventures, without depending on major
      record labels. Lost Kids therefore embodies artistic and financial
      autonomy, as well as a culture of <strong>experimentation</strong> and <strong>freedom.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of the label is deeply community-driven. It remains true to its
      origin as a crew, a group of <strong>lost</strong> but <strong>passionate</strong> young people, fighting to
      find meaning in a confusing world. This marginal and alternative energy
      has become both an aesthetic and ideological signature, attracting artists
      who share the same pursuit of <strong>authenticity</strong> and <strong>depth.</strong>
